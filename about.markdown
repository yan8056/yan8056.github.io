ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm MUSESE00([@yan8056](https://github.com/yan8056)).

âŒ¨ A back-end software development engineer and a cat lover.

ðŸ’— I dream of independently developing a software that is loved and widely used by people.

 Although I have been working for several years, but I just work for survival.
 One day, I realized that this would not work, and I would probably stay here ten years later.
 I began to recall my thoughts when I first entered this industry.
 Now I decide to explore the secrets of computers from scratch and start designing my own software.
 I hope I can fulfill my dream before I have children and a husbandðŸ˜†.

 Based on these situations, I will publish some of my learning and research (perhaps development) content here.
 I hope these contents can also help you.

 If you have any questions or want to discuss with me, please contact me through my email. It's in the footer of this site.

Thank you for reading :)
